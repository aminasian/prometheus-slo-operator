# Prometheus SLO Operator

This project is originally inspired by Spotahome's open source project 
[service-level-operator](https://github.com/spotahome/service-level-operator). Much like Spotahome's 
`service-level-operator`
project, this project and its many examples draw heavily on material, processes and strategies originally defined in the
first edition of the Google SRE Handbook. Use the below table of contents to quickly browse this project's
